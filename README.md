# Pixi Sven Workshop

This project provides resources for creating a browser game using Pixi.js as a part of a beginners workshop for programming. The theme of the workshop is the classic game from the 2000s - Sven Bomwollen - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sven_Bomwollen.

The project is based on the following pixi boilerplate, which takes care of most of the heavy lifting that is required in starting such a project (see details in the link) https://github.com/dopamine-lab/pixi-boilerplate

The repo includes working assets and code versions organized in 4 main chapters:
- project setup, loading assets, drawing sprites, handling user input
- spritesheets, tweens, game entities
- map, tiles, isometry
- character control

After covering these key topics, the workshop can progress into different directions:
- adding more gameplay and animations (sven - sheep interaction)
- adding timers, score, end game logic
- detailed information how isometry works, basic collision logic
- adding sounds and sound control logic
- adding a dog entity - handling multiple moving entities, pathfinding
